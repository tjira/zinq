- [x] The RingBufferArray could be probably modified to a more generic ObjectArray that would support any object type and not just ring buffers.
- [ ] Implement variable number of points in each dimension in quantum dynamics grid.
- [x] Remove the need to store the full grid in memory for quantum dynamics simulations. This would allow to simulate larger systems.
- [x] Jumps in FSSH should attempt each quantum step, not each classical step.
- [ ] Implement general multilinear interpolation for specifying the multi-dimensional potential energy surfaces from files.
- [x] Implement binary search for searching corners in multi-dimensional interpolation.
- [x] Jacobi eigensolver should have a maximum number of iterations to avoid infinite loops.
- [x] Make the basis sets embedded in the code.
- [x] Implement the potential plotting target.
- [x] Add timer to the quantum dynamics and classical dynamics iterations.
- [x] Implement the mmAlloc function that allocates the resulting matrix.
- [x] Implement the eigensystemSymmetricAlloc function that allocates the resulting eigenvalues and eigenvectors.
- [x] Implement the linsolveSymmetric function.
- [x] Implement the DIIS for HF method.
- [ ] Compress the basis set data to reduce the size of the executable.
- [x] Implement some basic parallelization algorithm.
- [ ] Precompute the primitive gaussian norms.
- [ ] Parallelize classical trajectories.
- [ ] Parallelize Fock matrix construction.
- [ ] Check if some parallelization is possible for quantum dynamics and implement it.
- [ ] Implement variable gammas for each dimension in quantum dynamics.
