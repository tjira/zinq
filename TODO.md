- [ ] Implement variable number of points in each dimension in quantum dynamics grid.
- [x] Remove the need to store the full grid in memory for quantum dynamics simulations. This would allow to simulate larger systems.
- [x] Jumps in FSSH should attempt each quantum step, not each classical step.
- [x] Implement general multilinear interpolation for specifying the multi-dimensional potential energy surfaces from files.
- [x] Implement binary search for searching corners in multi-dimensional interpolation.
- [x] Jacobi eigensolver should have a maximum number of iterations to avoid infinite loops.

- [x] Implement the mmAlloc function that allocates the resulting matrix.
- [x] Implement the eigensystemSymmetricAlloc function that allocates the resulting eigenvalues and eigenvectors.
- [x] Implement the linsolveSymmetric function.
- [x] Implement the DIIS for HF method.
- [ ] Compress the basis set data to reduce the size of the executable.
- [x] Implement some basic parallelization algorithm.
- [ ] Precompute the primitive gaussian norms.
- [x] Parallelize classical trajectories.
- [x] Parallelize Fock matrix construction.
- [ ] Check if some parallelization is possible for quantum dynamics and implement it.
- [x] Implement variable gammas for each dimension in quantum dynamics.
- [x] Parallelization of classical trajectories takes too much memory when many trajectories are run. Implement a more memory-efficient parallelization scheme.
- [x] Implement better potential and potential derivative integrators in vMCG.
- [x] Check the potential energy matrix element calculation of vibronic coupling potential and if it matches the matrix evaluation.
- [x] Specify the differentiation step fot vMCG method.
- [ ] Figure out a better way to store the file and custom potentials instead of just using global variables.
- [x] Integrals over gaussians with complex gamma are not implemented. Implement them.
- [x] The Riccati equations may produce non-unitary propagation in ss-vMCG, since I do not include derivative with respect to gamma in the tau matrix.
- [ ] Make the Strassen algorithm for squaring large numbers.
- [x] Make the eigenvalue solver target for complex hermitian matrices.
- [ ] The QD code calculates FFT for propagation and also for kinetic energy. Find a way to reuse the FFTs for both purposes to save time.
- [x] The Shunting-Yard algorithm should be extended to treat constants and functions.
- [x] LZ formula doesnt use the true minimum energy gap. Interpolate the potential energy surfaces somehow.
- [x] Make the pip executables executable even for other users. Currently they are only executable for the user that installed them.
- [x] Check the coherences calculation in FSSH, MASH and QD, since it seems to be wrong. It should be the same for all methods, but it is not.
- [x] Operators in Shunting-Yard algorithm are binary, so negative numbers cannot be treated. Implement a way to treat negative numbers in the Shunting-Yard algorithm.
- [ ] Shunting-Yard algorithm should be extended to treat complex numbers.
- [ ] The JSON parser should tell user what fields are not recognized and what fields are missing.
