- [x] The RingBufferArray could be probably modified to a more generic ObjectArray that would support any object type and not just ring buffers.
- [ ] Implement variable number of points in each dimension in quantum dynamics grid.
- [ ] Remove the need to store the full grid in memory for quantum dynamics simulations. This would allow to simulate larger systems.
- [x] Jumps in FSSH should attempt each quantum step, not each classical step.
- [ ] Implement general multilinear interpolation for specifying the multi-dimensional potential energy surfaces from files.
- [ ] Implement binary search for searching corners in multi-dimensional interpolation.
